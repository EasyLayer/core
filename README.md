## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher
- **TypeScript:** As the primary programming language

## üß© Our Concept

Our solutions are built on the following **principles and technologies**:

- **Node.js & TypeScript:** Ensuring modern, efficient, and type-safe development.
- **NestJS:** Leveraging NestJS for a modern, robust, and scalable software architecture.
- **Event Sourcing:** Capturing all changes to an application state as a sequence of events.
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS):** Separating read and write operations for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Structuring the software around the business domain for clarity and flexibility.

Developers define **database schemas** and **data storage mechanisms**, then run the applications on their own machines. Our applications communicate via **RPC** to request blocks from their own node or a provider, process the data, and store it in the appropriate database according to the defined schema. This approach ensures that our solutions are **universal** and **adaptable** to any data scheme.
