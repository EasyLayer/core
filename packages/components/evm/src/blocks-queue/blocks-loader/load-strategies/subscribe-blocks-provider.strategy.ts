/**
 * Subscription-based blocks loading strategy that sets up WebSocket subscription to new blocks.
 *
 * This strategy performs initial catch-up to sync with the current network height before
 * establishing the subscription to ensure no blocks are missed during the setup phase.
 *
 * The strategy:
 * 1. Performs initial catch-up from queue.lastHeight to currentNetworkHeight
 * 2. Sets up WebSocket subscription for new incoming blocks
 * 3. Filters and enqueues blocks based on queue state and termination conditions
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const strategy = new SubscribeBlocksProviderStrategy(
 *   logger,
 *   blockchainProvider,
 *   queue,
 *   config
 * );
 *
 * await strategy.load(12345); // Catch up to height 12345 then subscribe
 * ```
